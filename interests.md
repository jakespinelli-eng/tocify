## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves electrophysiology or physiological time series
  (EEG/MEG/LFP/iEEG/ECoG/neuronal spiking) OR aperiodic/1/f, oscillations, waveform shape,
  spectral parameterization, or neuronal timescales — OR introduces a general time-series/signal
  processing method that would transfer to those data.

If it is primarily about drugs/behavior/psychiatric symptoms without neural/physio time-series analysis,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily microbiology/immunology/metabolism/genetics without neural dynamics methods,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
My research focuses on the design, modeling, and experimental characterization of air-breathing plasma propulsion systems for very low Earth orbit (VLEO) applications. I use computational, experimental, and data-driven approaches to study plasma generation, ionization efficiency, thrust production, and thrust-to-power optimization under rarefied atmospheric conditions. My work integrates plasma physics, electromagnetics, gas dynamics, and propulsion systems engineering to enable sustained satellite operation at altitudes below conventional drag limits.

A central theme of my research is understanding and improving the fundamental plasma processes that govern thrust generation in air-breathing electric propulsion devices. I investigate discharge physics, plasma–surface interactions, and energy coupling mechanisms in vacuum arc, pulsed plasma, and hybrid discharge thrusters. By developing and applying advanced diagnostic methods and scalable analysis tools, my work seeks to disentangle the relative roles of ionization efficiency, mass utilization, and electromagnetic acceleration in determining overall system performance.

I work extensively with heterogeneous experimental datasets, including electrical diagnostics, thrust measurements, high-speed imaging, and pressure-controlled flow environments, emphasizing reproducible experimental design and rigorous data analysis. My research includes the design and fabrication of thruster hardware, development of high-vacuum and hypersonic airflow simulators, and quantitative evaluation of thrust-to-power ratio, erosion behavior, and operational lifetime. These efforts aim to directly link plasma behavior and discharge dynamics to measurable propulsion performance.

More broadly, my work examines how plasma dynamics and electromagnetic field configurations enable efficient momentum transfer in low-density environments. Using experimental testing, numerical modeling, and cross-comparison of air-breathing propulsion architectures, I study how these mechanisms scale with altitude, power, and propellant availability. I am particularly interested in methodological and theoretical advances that improve interpretation of plasma diagnostics, enable performance scaling laws, and support the development of compact, long-lived propulsion systems for next-generation Earth-observation missions.

I prioritize research that introduces new propulsion concepts, diagnostic methodologies, or performance insights relevant to air-breathing electric propulsion, plasma thrusters, and VLEO mission architectures. I am generally not interested in purely mission-level simulations or non-experimental studies unless they directly inform thruster physics, performance scaling, or hardware design decisions.
