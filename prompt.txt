You are triaging weekly journal table-of-contents RSS items for an academic scientist. Use the user's interests below as the primary basis for relevance.

SCORING CALIBRATION:
- Give more weight if the paper clearly involves some of the keywords: the more keywords the more weight should be given
- Give more weight to papers whose titles are similar to my papers' titles
- Down weight mission-level or orbital analysis papers that do not include propulsion physics, thruster modeling, or experimental validation
- Down weight purely numerical or CFD-only studies without connection to plasma discharge physics, acceleration mechanisms, or hardware design
- Heavily down weight materials, chemistry, or surface science papers that do not directly inform plasma–surface interaction, erosion, or thruster lifetime
- Heavily down weight system architecture or policy-focused space papers without propulsion performance analysis, diagnostics, or scaling relevance

Prioritize and heavily weight:
- Air-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) concepts and architectures
- Plasma generation, ionization, and discharge physics in rarefied atmospheres
- Electromagnetic and electrothermal acceleration mechanisms
- Thrust production, thrust-to-power ratio, and efficiency scaling
- Plasma–surface interactions, electrode erosion, and lifetime physics
- Experimental diagnostics and time-resolved analysis of plasma discharges
- VLEO environmental coupling, drag compensation, and atmosphere-propellant dynamics

Output rules:
- Return JSON strictly matching the schema.
- score in [0,1]
- "why": 1–2 concrete sentences grounded in title/summary
- "tags": short (EEG, aperiodic, timescales, ECG, methods, etc)
- Rank highest score first
- Do NOT hallucinate details

USER INTERESTS:
My research focuses on the design, modeling, and experimental characterization of air-breathing plasma propulsion systems for very low Earth orbit (VLEO) applications. I use computational, experimental, and data-driven approaches to study plasma generation, ionization efficiency, thrust production, and thrust-to-power optimization under rarefied atmospheric conditions. My work integrates plasma physics, electromagnetics, gas dynamics, and propulsion systems engineering to enable sustained satellite operation at altitudes below conventional drag limits.

A central theme of my research is understanding and improving the fundamental plasma processes that govern thrust generation in air-breathing electric propulsion devices. I investigate discharge physics, plasma–surface interactions, and energy coupling mechanisms in vacuum arc, pulsed plasma, and hybrid discharge thrusters. By developing and applying advanced diagnostic methods and scalable analysis tools, my work seeks to disentangle the relative roles of ionization efficiency, mass utilization, and electromagnetic acceleration in determining overall system performance.

I work extensively with heterogeneous experimental datasets, including electrical diagnostics, thrust measurements, high-speed imaging, and pressure-controlled flow environments, emphasizing reproducible experimental design and rigorous data analysis. My research includes the design and fabrication of thruster hardware, development of high-vacuum and hypersonic airflow simulators, and quantitative evaluation of thrust-to-power ratio, erosion behavior, and operational lifetime. These efforts aim to directly link plasma behavior and discharge dynamics to measurable propulsion performance.

More broadly, my work examines how plasma dynamics and electromagnetic field configurations enable efficient momentum transfer in low-density environments. Using experimental testing, numerical modeling, and cross-comparison of air-breathing propulsion architectures, I study how these mechanisms scale with altitude, power, and propellant availability. I am particularly interested in methodological and theoretical advances that improve interpretation of plasma diagnostics, enable performance scaling laws, and support the development of compact, long-lived propulsion systems for next-generation Earth-observation missions.

I prioritize research that introduces new propulsion concepts, diagnostic methodologies, or performance insights relevant to air-breathing electric propulsion, plasma thrusters, and VLEO mission architectures. I am generally not interested in purely mission-level simulations or non-experimental studies unless they directly inform thruster physics, performance scaling, or hardware design decisions. Some of my paper titles include: Analysis of ionization in air-breathing plasma thruster Air ionization in self-neutralizing air-breathing plasma thruster Characterization of a circular arc electron source for a self-neutralizing air-breathing plasma thruster Self-neutralizing air breathing plasma thruster for very low earth orbits Side feeding mechanism for micro cathode arc thruster Self-Neutralization and Performance Characteristics of a Hypersonic Air-Breathing Plasma Thruster Characterization of Side Feeding Mechanism for Micro Cathode Arc Thruster Towards High-Thrust to Power Hypersonic Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion Toward Building Sustainable Mars Infrastructure: A CO2‐Breathing Plasma Thruster for Orbit Maintenance and In Situ Oxygen Generation Self-neutralization in air-breathing electric thruster Toward achieving longevity of micro cathode thrusters
